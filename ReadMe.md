This application is a combination of Node JS, Express and Mongodb. 
It allows the user to create/save a christmas song and see a confirmation it saved to mongo. The user can also 
do a keyword search against the song database. I intend to add a batch of songs for indexing so there will be 
more content to search. This is a simple application to reacquaint myself with Node Js and some of the MEAN stack.
